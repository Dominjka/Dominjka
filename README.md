### Hi,

My name is Dominika Giugno and I am an aspiring manual tester who would like to take on new challenges.
Last months I have been developing myself in the area of **software quality**.
I have finished a **testing course** and started testing Web- and mobile applications at **uTest** - a crowd testing platform.
I am taking a part of **DARE IT** Mentoring Program where I work with my mentor on improving my testing skills, learning new tools and getting knowledge in the area of: 
- SQL 
- Github, Git 
- API (REST, SOAP)
- Postman 
- Devtools

I am also preparing myself to take the **ISTQB Foundation level** exam.


Last 5 years I have been working as an Accountant using the **SAP ERP**.
During this time I worked in 3 different teams on different projects.

The last project I have been working with was based on **Autobank**, apart from all of the tasks connected with accountancy I have been creating payment rules in Autobank accordingly to the business requirements and testing them so then payments could be posted automatically by SAP.
I also had a possibility to perform **smoke tests** by installing new GUI for SAP and report all of the details of the installation, any issues and changes.
I was also working on improvements with business connected with creating new payment rules in Autobank.
