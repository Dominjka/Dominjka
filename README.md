### Hi,

My name is Dominika Giugno and I am a manual software tester. 
Over the past few months, I have been focusing on expanding my knowledge and skills in the field of **software quality**. 
I completed a **testing course** and gained practical experience by testing web and mobile applications on **uTest**, a crowd testing platform. Additionally, I participated in the **DARE IT** Mentoring Program, where I have been working with a mentor to improve my testing skills, explore new tools, and gain expertise in areas such as:
- SQL 
- Github, Git 
- API (REST, SOAP) 
- Postman
- Devtools. 

Recently, I completed a 2-month **Quality Assurance Internship**, and I am currently employed as a **software tester**.

I am also preparing myself to take the **ISTQB Foundation level** exam.


Last 5 years I have been working as an Accountant using the **SAP ERP**.
During this time I worked in 3 different teams on different projects.

The last project I have been working with was based on **Autobank**, apart from all of the tasks connected with accountancy I have been creating payment rules in Autobank accordingly to the business requirements and testing them so then payments could be posted automatically by SAP.
I also had a possibility to perform **smoke tests** by installing new GUI for SAP and report all of the details of the installation, any issues and changes.
I was also working on improvements with business connected with creating new payment rules in Autobank.
